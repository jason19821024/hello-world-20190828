20190828-Jason reboot again. Add oil. 
I know I can do it, just use my brain.
Hi, this is Jason, 37.
I am Chinese, teaching English at present.
I am a student who resolves to learn coding.
I love to learn coding because I believe English + coding = freedom.
I know everything has a price.
I believe I can make it and I would try my very best.
Pleasure to be here.
Thanks to Li Xiaolai, my mentor.
